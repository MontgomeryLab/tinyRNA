## Diagnostic Info

### 1. Terminal Output
If the terminal output from the failing command is still available, please export it to a text file and attach it or paste it here. On macOS, one option is to use the terminal menu to select `Shell > Export Text As...` and save the output to a file, but this will save *everything* in the scrollback, so you may need to edit the file to remove sensitive/irrelevant information.

### 2. Configuration Files
If the failing command is `tiny` or `tiny-count`, please find the /config subdirectory in the Run Directory that was produced by the failing command, compress or archive it, and attach it here. On macOS, one option is to right-click the directory in Finder and select `Compress "config"`, then attach the resulting .zip file here.

### 3. Log Files
If the failing command is `tiny`, please find the /logs subdirectory in the Run Directory that was produced by the failing command, compress or archive it, and attach it here.
