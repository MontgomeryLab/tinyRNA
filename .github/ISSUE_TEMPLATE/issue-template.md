If you would like to report a bug, please fill out the template below. Before submitting your issue, make sure it is not repeated in [open issues](https://github.com/MontgomeryLab/aquatx-srna/issues). 

For enhancements, please make sure we are already not working on this under [projects](https://github.com/MontgomeryLab/aquatx-srna/projects). Instead of filling out the template, just describe the feature you think would be useful to have. Any additional info that provides context or how you envision it implemented is also helpful.

## Reproducible example

```
Please replace this text with the commands you used to produce the error
```

If you are using data files, we may need more information on the file (you may send it via email or attach it here) or if you give a snippet of the file we can test it. We need to be able to reproduce the error to know when we've fixed it. If you can use simple generated data that is similar to yours & still get the bug, that would be the best option. Ideally, attach an MCVE to the report that we can run here. 

## Input configuration 

```
Please attach as a file or paste in this block your configuration file (the dated one)

## Error message and traceback

Please replace this text & copy the output of the code when it errors
